# Hello people from youtube! [PROJECT VIDEO LINK]()

### What is this repo?

This is all the supporting code for the 8-bit computer I made in Minecraft.

## How can I use it?

I would not recommend trying to use it.

The point of this repository is to give those who are curious a look at the code I wrote- that is all. My video on its own did not explain many important aspects of my assembly language such as definitions, labels, and more (which was on purpose for simplification). 

Perhaps in the far future I will create a cpu that is more user friendly. For now though, I encourage you to try to make your own! It's more fun when you've made it yourself, and you'll get a lot more out of it.

If you want to get more involved with redstone cpu making, join the ORE (Open Redstone Engineers) discord [here](https://openredstone.org/discord), and/or join my redstone discord [here](discord.gg/V5KFaF63mV)!
