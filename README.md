# Hello people from youtube!

### What is this repo?

This is all the supporting code I wrote for the [8-bit computer I made in Minecraft]().

## How can I use it?

I would not recommend trying to use it. Sorry :(

The point of this repository is to give those who are curious a look at the code I wrote- that is all. Perhaps in the future I will create a cpu that is more user friendly. For now though, I encourage you to try to make your own! It's more fun when you've made it yourself, and you'll get a lot more out of it. Additionally, I am devoting summer of 2023 to create a brand new, comprehensive computational redstone tutorial series, so stay tuned for that if you are someone who loves learning this type of redstone.

If you want to get more involved with redstone cpu making, join the ORE (Open Redstone Engineers) discord [here](https://openredstone.org/discord), and/or join my redstone discord [here](discord.gg/V5KFaF63mV)!
